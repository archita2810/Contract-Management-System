# Contract-Management-System
  
  'Contract Management System' is a desktop application developed using Windows forms C#.NET and Microsoft SQL Server as database.
Also the SLRDb Connector is used for the database connectivity purpose.

  The 'Contract Management System' is implemented for a construction company who designate a project manager to oversee and allocate
resources for various construction projects. Project managers work closely with engineers and architects to develop plans and establish 
timetable and determine labor and material costs. So it becomes important to maintain a record of each ongoing task of their live projects
of various locations on-site as well as in documents.

  Hence in this project, the manager can keep a track of contractors who will be directing the work flow on site. Whenever one task is completed,
the next task will be allocated with estimated price to the contractor in-charge by the manager and get the work done. Once the task is assigned
he will keep a track on how much work is completed and accordingly it will be presented on the screen. We can also view the recent report of each
contractor in our project.
